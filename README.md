# Map-Navigator-Project
This Java program calculates fare and shortest distance between two vertices in Bhubaneswar using Graph and Heap. Nodes store names, edges show distances, and algorithms like Dijkstra, BFS, and DFS find the shortest path. Main.java handles graph logic, and Heap.java manages pathfinding.
